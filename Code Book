x_test
contains recorded features test data
y_test 
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train 
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train
contains recorded features train data
y_train
contains train data of activities’code labels

2 merge training and test datasets 
append x train and x test and name it 'x'
append y train and y test and name it 'y'
append subject train and subject test and name it 'subject'
get merge data from combining 'subject' and 'x' and 'y' and name it tidydata

3 extract columns with mean and standard deviation 
select subject,code and columns with mean, std from tidydata

4 use activity name to name activities in the "tidydata"

5 clean column names
